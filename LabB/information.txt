Hero.readBook()

The function starts with a conditional statement that checks if the heros level is high enough to read the book, if not then the program will output that the heros level is not high enough and do nothing else
otherwise the heros current skill is set to the skill of the book using the getSkill method from the book class
then it outputs that the hero has read the book and what skill it has gained
finally the heros level is incremented by 1 using getters and setters of the hero class
