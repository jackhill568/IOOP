To solve Task 2 i decided to move all the logic for interacting with an object from MovementAdapter.moveHero() to the 
handleInteractions function in GameController. This 
allows me to easily catch cursed book exceptions as
all the logic is in the same place. This structure 
also lets me easily select what to perfom after the user
has decided to interact or not. I use the JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog 
to get the user decision this outputs a 1 or 0 which i 
can use for the selection.
